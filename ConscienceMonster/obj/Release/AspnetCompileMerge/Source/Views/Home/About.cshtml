    <h2>About</h2>
    Conscience Monster, an indie/alternative band from Atlanta, Ga, consists of five members, all coming together from various lifestyles and ages to form the band over the last couple of years.  
Ben Leak and Shaun Roberts, who have known each other and played music together since they were both in middle school, started hanging out in a tiny room in Ben's house, writing songs while drinking copious amounts of wine after the death of their friend and bandmate Adam Higginbotham.  Later, once they grew bored of the inherent homoeroticism of two dudes getting drunk and playing music together alone in a room, they happened to meet Robert Evans through mutual friends and a well-named bar trivia team, Hung Like Jesus.  After finding that Robert had played drums in UGA's marching band, he soon became the third member of the band.  Over the next year, guitarists and bass players would join and leave the band constantly, until eventually, with few options remaining, Ben turned to craigslist, where he found bass-playing, sound-engineering Adam Norris to fill out the rhythm section and begin to round out the band's sound.  Finally, during a night out at the bar after band practice, pondering whether he would like another guitarist in the band other than himself, Ben happened to meet Eric Amata, and over a discussion of the NFL Draft, eventually learned that Eric also played guitar.  A tryout occurred soon after, and Eric decided the band might just be good enough for him to grace it with his thick dark beard and slide guitar.
